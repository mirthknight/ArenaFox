# Arena Fox Login UI

Modern, interactive login experience for the Arena Fox dashboard (Kingshot event management). Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Mantine components, Headless UI switches, and motion-enhanced iconography.

## Scripts
- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm run dev` — start local dev server
- `npm run build` — type-check and build for production
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint for TypeScript/React files

## Notes
- Design includes placeholders for vector illustrations; see `IMAGE_ASSETS.md` for guidance and suggested subjects.
- Layout combines Mantine cards/inputs with Tailwind glassmorphism and Headless UI toggles to satisfy modern component expectations.
- Supports responsive breakpoints, neon gradients, and dark-default theming for the Arena Fox aesthetic.
