# Arena Fox Login Experience — Image & Illustration Guide

Use the following references when replacing placeholders with production-ready assets. All images should support dark backgrounds and feel modern, tactical, and game-ready.

## Hero & Login Card
- **Primary hero illustration:** A semi-abstract vector of a command bridge or mission control room with holographic UI panels. Prefer gradients with teal, indigo, and violet to match the neon palette.
- **Accent spark icon:** Minimal, glowing spark or particle effect that can loop subtly near the CTA button.
- **Workspace identity:** Small badge-style icon for Kingshot servers (e.g., a shield with server number or a stylized fox silhouette).
- **Login illustration slot:** The dashed placeholder on the page should host either a geometric fox crest or a linked-alliance totem graphic to reinforce the Arena Fox identity.

## Feature Tiles
- **Alliance onboarding:** Vector showing linked banners or connected shields to represent multiple alliances under one workspace.
- **Event intelligence:** Calendar with motion arrows or notification pips; clean line-art with soft gradients.
- **Bear battle tracker:** Stylized bear trap or radar sweep graphic with pulsing rings.
- **Custom data pages:** Modular blocks or cards stacking, suggesting customizable fields.

## UI Ornamentation
- **Floating orbs/gradients:** Soft, blurred shapes in teal, cyan, and violet for atmospheric depth.
- **Security highlight:** Shield or lock icon with a glow, suitable for the “Security review” action.

## Usage Recommendations
- Provide SVG or high-res PNG exports at 2x sizing for crisp rendering on retina displays.
- Keep backgrounds transparent; let the app’s gradient and glass effects show through.
- Favor geometric, minimal styles to pair well with the glassmorphic panels and neon accents used throughout the login page.
