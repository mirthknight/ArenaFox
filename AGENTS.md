# Agent Guide and Project Plan Anchor

## Scope
These notes apply to the entire repository. Keep this file and `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` updated as work progresses.

## Standing Requirements (apply to every request)
1. Maintain consistency in style and UI across login and dashboard experiences.
2. Ensure database SQL schema and key queries are documented and available for Supabase.
3. Organize code, modules, and logic into reusable folders and components.
4. Do not include sensitive information (credentials, secrets, personal data) in code or docs.
5. Keep the website fully responsive and mobile-friendly; align UI elements consistently across breakpoints.

## Working Notes
- Update `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` whenever requirements change or milestones are completed so new contributors can see history and next steps.
- Keep database docs in `database/` aligned with front-end capabilities (profiles, badges, invites, likes, enable/disable).
